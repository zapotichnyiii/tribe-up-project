# TribeUp

TribeUp is a front-end web application designed to connect people by allowing them to find, create, and join local events based on shared interests. It's a concept for a community-building platform where finding new friends and planning activities is simple and intuitive.

This project is built entirely as a front-end application and uses the browser's **localStorage** to simulate a database for users, events, chats, and interests.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **User Authentication:** A modern, tabbed interface for user login and registration. Includes registration consent for personal data processing.
